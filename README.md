# Judging-Pre-owned-bicycle-Deals-Type-Using-Machine-Learning-Methods

Under the influence brought by Covid-19, people who used to take bus for commuting and traveling are tending to cycle to the places they would like to go. So many of them choose to buy a pre-owned bike because of the cheap price. However, many of them complaint that they didn’t get the lowest price they could get. The focus of this study is using logistic regression to build a classifier to determine if a pre-owned road bicycle deal is a good deal or not. Unlike new prod- ucts with a fixed price, asymmetric information between the sellers and buyers before the transaction, lack of reliable transactional schemes due to frequent frauds and chaos during the transactions, and missing after-sales guarantee mechanism in pre-owned things deals. The result of the study could help people intending to buy a pre-owned road bicycle before they make the deal by letting them enter the key information of the bicycle they are about to buy and predict if the deal is a good deal or not, where "0" represent the bad deal while "1" represents the opposite.

## Background
- Liyourong Wang
  - The author has been in love with cycling sport since the day he put his foot on the peddle, being a pro-cyclist to race in Tour de France has been his days and dreams
  - During the Covid-19 time, the author spotted the market demand towards bicycles, so he started his pre-owned bike dealer career, at the mean time, the author was amazed by the power of machine learning from his "Credit Card Fraud" project. SO he developed a pre-owned bike deal classifier to help him 
- Demographical Background
  - Governments propose maintaining a social distance between people for safety concerns, making taking public transportations like metros and buses for people to be unlikely. Comsumers need a bike to commute.
  - A normal consumer would have trouble distinguishing the value of the bicycle and then buying a bicycle at a higher price

After conducting a survey towards the consumers, the author set Age, Transmission Kit, Frame Material, Brand and Price as the input of the classifier.
